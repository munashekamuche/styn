BRUSHER FONT INSTALLATION
========================

The "Styn" logo uses the Brusher font - a beautiful brush script typeface.

TO ADD THE BRUSHER FONT:
------------------------

1. Download Brusher font from one of these sources:
   - DaFont: https://www.dafont.com/brusher.font
   - Font Squirrel: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/brusher
   - 1001 Fonts: https://www.1001fonts.com/brusher-font.html

2. After downloading, extract the font files and place them in this folder:
   - Brusher.ttf (required)
   - Brusher.woff (optional, for better web performance)
   - Brusher.woff2 (optional, for best web performance)

3. If you only have the .ttf file, you can convert it to .woff and .woff2 using:
   - https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff
   - https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff2

The CSS is already configured to load the font from this folder.
If the font files are not present, "Kaushan Script" (from Google Fonts) will be used as a fallback.
